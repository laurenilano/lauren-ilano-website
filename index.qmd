# Howdy!

I am a higher education researcher by day (but preferably night) and a lifelong student. I love to read, hate to write, but enjoy torturing myself so here is a blog! I'm about 20 years late to the party which pretty much tells you everything you need to know about me. Oh, and I love cats because of course I do.
