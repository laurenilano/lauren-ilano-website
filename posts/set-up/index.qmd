This is my second try at having a blog! 

I was motivated to do this because I want to, you know, get out there. 

Also, I have been using a lot of markdown lately and figured I could just copy and paste stuff from my Obsidian notes into this blog pretty easily. I also recently came across the idea of "learning in public" and really liked it. 

It appealed to me because I love to learn and often find myself on the absorb side of the absorb/expunge binary. Its a spectrum I'm sure, but I have relegated myself to an extreme pole...

Anyways, I am always learning and often feel too ashamed to say or post something unless its perfect and I am coming to realize that if I wait that long, the world will end! So hello, world! Here is me learning.
