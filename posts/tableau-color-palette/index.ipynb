        "In higher education, most colleges have their style guide or brand guidelines on their website so usually when I work with a new client or get a new job, I often just add their color palette to Tableau if I plan to do any visualizations. UCLA for example has a very comprehensive webpage dedicated to their color palette and some strict rules about their brand identity [here](https://brand.ucla.edu/identity/colors).^[As an aside, it's really funny to me how seriously some colleges take their brand identity. It's especially rich for an institution within a system like UCLA to use blue and gold to differentiate itself from all the other UCs that also use blue and gold. As they state on their brand guidelines website: \"UCLA's colors evoke the blue of the sea and sky and the gold of the sun and wildflowers, especially the California poppy. There's a brightness to UCLA Blue and UCLA Gold that's especially appropriate to Southern California, and different from other University of California campuses.\" Okay...lol.] \n",

In most cases, I've found that the style guides often have the hex codes, but if they only provide RGB values, you can always use a converter online^[This is a useful RGB to HEX converter: https://htmlcolorcodes.com/rgb-to-hex/].
