I also recently came across the idea of “learning in public” and really liked it.\nIt appealed to me because I love to learn and often find myself on the absorb side of the absorb/expunge binary. Its a spectrum I’m sure, but I have relegated myself to an extreme pole…\nAnyways, I am always learning and often feel too ashamed to say or post something unless its perfect and I am coming to realize that if I wait that long, the world will end! So hello, world! Here is me learning."

    "text": "SQL, Databases, and R\nPrior to working in IR, I had tried my best to learn SQL through online tutorials, but it was always difficult to grasp how I would use SQL on a daily basis because I never learned anything beyond the syntax. I knew how to write a select statement, but I couldn’t necessarily imagine how and where I would type these statements in the real world.\n\n\nThe bigger picture\nThis blog post is the beginning of a series of posts that will hopefully help folks see how to host and query a database locally (using SQLiteStudio) and eventually connect to the database from R using the odbc package. To show the basic steps to set up and connect to a db, we will be using a simple toy database, chinook, that is widely available. My hope in the future is to create a toy IR database that is more similar to the types of queries we would run as IR professionals (i.e., fake student enrollment data, course/section data, term data, etc.)\n\n\nWhat is SQLite\n\n\nSetting Up SQLite and SQLiteStudio\n\n\nImporting the Chinook Database\n\n\nExploring the Database"

    "text": "While you could embed all your SQL queries into your .R scripts, it can get a bit messy. Instead, a better approach is to write out your SQL queries in SQLite Studio (or whatever GUI you prefer) and pulling in only the resulting table in R.\nThis has a few advantages. First, you are able to troubleshoot in the SQL Studio environment and make sure all the pesky variable names are correctly spelled 0:)\nSecondly, it helps modularize your code so if you decide you need to change a filter because now you want to exclude all dual enrolled students, you dont have to scroll to line 863 of your R script but can just open the .sql file and make the change there."

    "text": "As a consultant for EdTrust, I contributed to a report which examined faculty diversity relative to student diversity, as well as hiring equity, tenure equity, and changes in faculty representation over time for Black and Latino faculty. Using publicly-available IPEDS data, we developed four metrics to assess faculty diversity at public, four-year universities.\nThe findings were not surprising. University faculty don’t reflect the demographics of their students and at more than half the universities in the sample, when faculty of color are hired they are are not on the tenure track. Mere representational diversity of faculty will not fix white supremacy in academia, especially when faculty of color are are subject to hostile climates1, presumed incompetence2, and structural racism. It’s necessary, but woefully insufficient.\nSee the full Faculty Diversity Report here\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nGriffin, K. 2019.
