    "text": "I can’t create my ugly frankenstein keys using duckdb because my precious NA strings go missing!\nAt my workplace, we do not have the luxury of having reliable student IDs for each record so that means we often use frankenstein keys to join data across sources. When I was going through this arduous process1 trying to join student information back to a National Student Clearinghouse data I discovered a quirk in duckdb() with the paste function. Our frankenstein keys have student information that is sometimes missing so we would expect an NA to appear in our key string.\nLet’s take a simplified example. Our key could have the student’s application ID, their birthday, and matriculation term all separated by a period. We would expect our key to look something like this:\n123456789.20000101.20184\nIf the birthday was missing for some reason, our key would be:\n123456789.NA.20184\nIn order to match across sources, the NA string is really important! But, when I was passing my parquet files from arrow to duckdb and using paste, I kept getting this:\n123456789.20184"

    "text": "Sometimes you have information that you want R to be able to access, without having to type it in every time. We do this all the time in a session when we create variables that hold a piece of information like a threshold value. But, sometimes you have variables that you want to set to access during all your sessions which is where the .Renviron file comes in. Setting environment variables in .Renviron is a convenient way to make the information available to all R sessions without having to type them in every time. These environment variables can be used to store various information such as the path to a data directory, API keys, and other important information that you don’t want to hardcode in your R scripts.\nWhen I was working on my dissertation, I never thought twice about hardcoding API keys because all the code was for my eyes only. (Unfortunately, that also introduced a whole host of issues related to clarity and just basic organization, but that is for another day.)\nAfter leaving academia and working in more collaborative environments, I really had to be more disciplined in my coding by becoming more careful about keeping my API keys and passwords private. I think in general, its just good practice to avoid hardcoding passwords–I mean, it seems pretty obvious to me now–but it never really came up in the courses I took.1\n\nIn this blog, I’ll walk you through creating the .Renviron file and how to use it to store an API Key. In particular, we will create and store an API Key for the College Scorecard dataset. You can manually download College Scorecard data, but we can also connect to the API and get data directly into R using the rscorecard package 2 developed by Ben Skinner.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBack-up…what is an API?\n\n\n\n\n\nAPI stands for Application Programming Interface and it essentially allows you to connect to the data elements that underlie a particular website. Zapier has a really good Introduction to APIs tutorial here.\nThe College Scorecard site was designed to be a useful tool for students to compare different institutions and there is a user interface that allows you to filter based on many different characteristics like cost, graduation rate, geographic location, etc. The interface is nice and all, but we can use the API to access the underlying data if we want to analyze it on our own."

If we go to the College Scorecard documentation site we can sign up for an API key using the form at the bottom of the page. After confirming we are not a bot, we just have to fill out our name and email address. In a few minutes, we will receive an email with our 40-character API key. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy do I need this pesky key??\n\n\n\n\n\nThey want to know who to come after (or ban) if you violate their terms. Don’t share your key because someone could do bad things and get you in trouble.\n\n\n\nNow that we have our API key, all we need to do is type the following into our .Renviron file:\n\nGOV_API_KEY=\"{your_40_digit_key}\"\n\nNow that we’ve set up our key, let’s try to use it. # Using environment variables in R\nOnce you have set the environment variables in .Renviron, you can use them in R by using the Sys.getenv() function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nMake sure to restart your R session after saving your .Renviron file!\n\n\nWe can test to make sure our environment variable is accessible to us by running the Sys.getenv() function. If we set up our environment variable correctly, we should see our 40-digit key in the console output after running this code:\n\nSys.getenv(GOV_API_KEY)\n\n[1] \"\""

    "text": "Downloading Scorecard Data\nThe rscorecard package is a great API wrapper in the R language that allows us to make API calls in the comfort of R. I encourage you to check out the package documentation for more information on all the package features.\nThe first thing you need to do when using the package is registering your API key in your R environment. The package has a function sc_key() that you use to set your API key, but in the documentation they suggest hardcoding your API key, which we are trying to avoid.\n\n# Example from rscorecard documentation:\n\n## use your real key in place of the Xs\nsc_key('xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx')\n\nLet’s try it by referencing the variable in our .Renviron file to demonstrate how our method allows for the same functionality without having to hardcode our API key in our script. Following the documentation, run the sc_key() function with to register our API key using the variable we set in .Renviron.\n\nlibrary(rscorecard)\nsc_key(Sys.getenv(\"GOV_API_KEY\"))\n\nDATAGOV_API_KEY environment variable now set. You may now use sc_get() without specifying a key.\n\n\nNow that we’ve set up our key, let’s request some data. Let’s get a list of HBCUs by state.\n\nsc_init() %&gt;%\n  sc_filter(hbcu==1) %&gt;%\n  sc_select(unitid, instnm, stabbr, hbcu) %&gt;%\n  sc_year('latest') %&gt;%\n  sc_get() %&gt;%\n  head()\n\nLarge request will require: 1 additional pulls.\n\n\nRequest additional chunk 1\n\n\nRequest complete!\n\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 5\n  unitid instnm                                            stabbr  hbcu year  \n   &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt;                                             &lt;chr&gt;  &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt; \n1 100654 Alabama A & M University                          AL         1 latest\n2 100724 Alabama State University                          AL         1 latest\n3 101240 Gadsden State Community College                   AL         1 latest\n4 101462 J.

It seems to work and we didn’t have to hardcode our API key. Now we can freely share the code with collaborators without having to worry that our private key will be compromised. And better yet, if they have their .Renviron variable set up, they can run the code and it will just work."

Using publicly-available IPEDS data, we developed four metrics to assess faculty diversity at public, four-year universities.\nThe findings were not surprising. University faculty don’t reflect the demographics of their students and at more than half the universities in the sample, when faculty of color are hired they are are not on the tenure track. Mere representational diversity of faculty will not fix white supremacy in academia, especially when faculty of color are are subject to hostile climates1, presumed incompetence2, and structural racism. It’s necessary, but woefully insufficient.\nSee the full Faculty Diversity Report here"
