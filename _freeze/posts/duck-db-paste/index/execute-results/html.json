When I was going through this arduous process^[I am being dramatic because it really isn't *that* bad] trying to join student information back to a National Student Clearinghouse data I discovered a quirk in `duckdb()` with the `paste` function. Our frankenstein keys have student information that is sometimes missing so we would expect an NA to appear in our key string.\n\nLet's take a simplified example. Our key could have the student's application ID, their birthday, and matriculation term all separated by a period. We would expect our key to look something like this:\n\n123456789.20000101.20184\n\nIf the birthday was missing for some reason, our key would be:\n\n123456789.NA.20184\n\nIn order to match across sources, the NA string is really important! But, when I was passing my parquet files from arrow to duckdb and using paste, I kept getting this:\n\n123456789.20184\n\n\n# Dude, where's my NA string?!!!\n\nNow, this is probably clearly stated in the documentation but uh, I did not read that. Instead I banged my head on the keyboard and kept running the same lines of code (and restarted my R session) for an embarrassingly long time hoping for a different result.\n\nMy code looked something like this (there was more there and I needed to pass to duckdb to do things arrow can't do yet):\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmy_parquet_file |>\nto_duckdb() |>\nmutate(franken_key = paste(applicant_ID, birthdate, matriculation_term, sep = \".\")) |>\ncollect()\n```\n:::\n\n\n# The (not-so) obvious solution\nAll I had to do was move the `collect()` function up (see below) and then the `paste()` function worked as expected so I could have my precious NA strings. This is all very obvious now, however I figured I would record this so I can commit this to memory and not have to deal with this again.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmy_parquet_file |>\nto_duckdb() |>\ncollect() |>\nmutate(franken_key = paste(applicant_ID, birthdate, matriculation_term, sep = \".\"))\n```\n:::\n",
