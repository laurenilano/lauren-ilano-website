Dual Enrollment for Equitable Completion (DE4EC) is a multi-year collaborative initiative among the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, College Futures Foundation, and Tipping Point Community, carried out with research support provided by [RDP Consulting](https://www.r-d-p-consulting.com/). DE4EC works with 10 CCCs and HS parners to advance equitable dual enrollment. 

The quantitative report and accompanying briefs use data from [CalPASS Plus](https://www.calpassplus.org/Home) to identify baseline dual enrollment offerings, disaggregated dual enrollment participation rates, high school outcomes, and college access metrics for the 10 partnerships supported by DE4EC.
